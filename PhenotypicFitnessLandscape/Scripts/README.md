## Phenotypic fitness landscapes
This directory contains scripts that facilitate the estimation and visualization of three-dimensional phenotypic fitness landscapes. More scripts to be uploaded soon. 

### GetGamVisFunction.R
This function is a modification of the gam.vis function in mgcv - it simply is modified to allow for more flexibility in plotting, and to return the full surface that is plotted. 

### Composite-MorphoGeno-AdaptLandscape-Bootstrapping.R
This script explores the extent to which the shape of the fitness landscape estimated using composite fitness as the response, and morphology/gitness associated snps as predictors, is robust to sampling uncertainty.
